## Purpose

The purpose of this project is create a version of the game Snake in Python

## Background

Snake is a video game concept in which the player moves around a line (the snake) which grows in length

## Gameplay

The player controls the snake's head on a screen by using up, down, left, and right arrow keys. At the start of the game, the head of the snake is centered in the screen. A piece of purple food is randomly placed on the screen. The player moves the snake to the food to grow the snake in length. When a piece of food is consumed, the snake's body increases by 1 block, and the score is increased. 

As the snake's head moves forward, its body follows. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) 2.0.1

## Usage

### Install Requirements

* Install pygame
```
$ pip install pygame 2.0.1
```

### Run Script

* Run snake.py to run the game
